* Fix setting white player rank not working in info drawer

## [Sabaki v0.30.1][v0.30.1] (2017-04-25)

**Added**

* The game graph has been rewritten from scratch and is now more efficient with large game trees without the need to collapse subtrees. The graph is more accessible, the nodes have a bigger click surface and dragging the graph can go beyond the component.
* The game collection manager includes support for `ngf` and `gib` files. It also sports a slick board animation, which is very slick. Did I mention it's slick?
* You can assign custom label texts to a vertex on the board by selecting the label or number tool and clicking 'Edit Label' in the context menu.
* You can attach two engines to Sabaki and let them play each other while you can sip tea comfortably and watch them fight. The GTP console has been redesigned so you are able to address both engines separately. It also displays (usually) useful `stderr` information from the engines. Command autocompletion is more obvious now.
* Drawing with the line/arrow tool makes it clear that drawing over an existing line/arrow removes that line/arrow.
* Ability to hide menu bar on Windows and Linux.

**Changed**

* Update to Electron v1.6.7 beta

**Fixed**

* When encoding is not specified, Sabaki tries to infer the encoding from content instead of assuming ISO-8859-1 (Thanks to [@fohristiwhirl](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl)).
* When `CA` property is missing from an opened file, Sabaki previously saves it without correct UTF-8 `CA` property. This results in Sabaki opening these files in ISO-8859-1, not correctly displaying text. This is fixed now.
* When attaching engines, Sabaki previously sends the `boardsize` command after `clear_board` which technically can result in arbitrary board positions on the engine. This is fixed now.
* Other Go software may specify the same property multiple times on a tree node, which technically makes the SGF invalid. Sabaki can handle these files now.

## [Sabaki v0.21.0][v0.21.0] (2017-03-30)

**Added**

* Support for Tygem `gib` files and WBaduk `ngf` files (Thanks to [@fohristiwhirl](https://github.com/fohristiwhirl))

* Move annotation context menu on the last played stone (Thanks to [@dfannius](https://github.com/dfannius))
